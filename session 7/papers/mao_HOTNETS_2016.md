### Summary

Inspired by recent advances in deep reinforcement learning, the author build systems [DeepRM] that learn to manage resources directly from experience.

### Cool Ideas


### Questions

Resource management problem are ubiquitous in computer systems and networks. There are many research directions such as job scheduling in clusters, bitrate adaptation in video streaming, relay selection in Internet telephony, virtual machine placement in cloud computing, congestion control can take the advantage of deep reinforcement learning to translate problem into a learning problem.
