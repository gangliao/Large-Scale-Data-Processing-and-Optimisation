### Summary

Inspired by recent advances in deep reinforcement learning, the author build systems [DeepRM: a simple multi-resource cluster scheduler] that learn to manage resources directly from experience.

Traditional solution for these problems are solved using meticulously designed heuristics. It's too specific and not a general purpose solution, which often must be
repeated if some metric changes. i.e., the workload. RL does not require any prior knowledge of the system's behavior to learn these strategies, it can support a variety of objectives just by using different reinforcement rewards.

### Cool Ideas


### Questions

Resource management problem are ubiquitous in computer systems and networks. There are many research directions such as job scheduling in clusters, bitrate adaptation in video streaming, relay selection in Internet telephony, virtual machine placement in cloud computing, congestion control can take the advantage of deep reinforcement learning to translate problem into a learning problem.
