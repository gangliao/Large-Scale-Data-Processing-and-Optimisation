### Summary

Deep reinforcement learning -> building autonomous systems with a higher level understanding of the visual world.

The rise of deep learning, relying on the `powerful function approximation` and `representation learning` properties of deep neural networks—has provided us with new tools to overcoming these problems: memory complexity, computational complexity and sample complexity.

The most important property of deep learning is that deep neural networks can automatically find compact low-dimensional representations (features) of high-dimensional data (e.g., images, text and audio). 

Deep learning algorithms within RL defining the field of “deep reinforcement learning” (DRL).

1. Deep Q-network

2. trust region policy optimisation

3. asynchronous advantage actor-critic
